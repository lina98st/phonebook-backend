## Part 3: Phonebook Backend

The backend for the Part 3 exercises (Phonebook application) is located in this repository under the `part3` folder.

The backend is also available in a separate repository:  
‚û°Ô∏è [phonebook-backend repository](https://github.com/lina98st/phonebook-backend)

The live deployed backend (and frontend build) is running on Render:  
üîó [https://phonebook-backend-ulf9.onrender.com/](https://phonebook-backend-ulf9.onrender.com/)

- The production build of the frontend is served directly by the backend.
- The backend API can be accessed at `/api/persons`.

Example:
